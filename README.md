The objective was to make several HTML/CSS pages more dynamic with various animations.

Project Constraints:

-The site must be coded in HTML/CSS without using any frameworks. The use of SASS is a plus.

-The site's colors are #9356DC, #FF79DA, and #99E2D0.

-The site must be responsive and adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile formats using media queries. The chosen breakpoints are 992px for desktop to tablet and 768px for tablet to mobile.

-The site consists of a homepage and four restaurant pages.

-The site uses Shrikhand for the logo and title, and Roboto for the rest of the text (Google Fonts).

-The site should be coded with a mobile-first approach.

-The design and aesthetic choices for tablet and desktop versions are up to the developer's discretion.

-Several animations are requested on the site: a loading spinner, a heart that fills on hover, "checkmarks" next to menu items, and a gradual appearance of menu items during the loading of a restaurant page.

-The site must be compatible with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.).

Finally, the code must be W3C compliant for both HTML and CSS.
